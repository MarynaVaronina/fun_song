It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic
One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal,
One golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One flash of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
Is this a kind of magic?
