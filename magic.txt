It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic

One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal,
One golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One flash of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a kind of magic

The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
Is this a kind of magic?

There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies,
It's a kind of magic

Is this a kind of magic?
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies,
It's a kind of magic

The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
A little bit of magic
Give it to me

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be,
Will soon be gone,
This is a kind of magic,
There can only be one
This rage that lasts a thousand years

Will soon be gone,
A little bit of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be,
Will soon be gone,
Will soon be gone
